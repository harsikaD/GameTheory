## Project Report Title: 
### Modelling Depression Among University Students using a Game Theoretic Approach

Description: 
In this Project, we try to prove a hypothesis that a university/college student surrounded by neighbouring students
who have a more positive life cycle/habits is less likely to get depressed as compared to one who has more positive
life cycle/habits as compared to most of his neighbours. We take help of Game theory to design a game that a
student plays in daily university life in the quest to achieve the Strongly Dominant Strategy in this Game. We will
take help of a well contained student related data set, and random lattice based simulation to prove the hypothesis
and the results would be validated using the Law of Large Numbers. We get some plausible results/conclusions
from this kind of amodelling that keeping a healthy amount of depressed students arranged closer to each other
may result in increase in the final no of depressed students.
